### .gitignore File
Here's a sample `.gitignore` file that would be relevant for a Python-based project with Streamlit:

```gitignore
# Python cache files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]

# Environment variables
.env

# Data files
*.xls
*.xlsx

# Jupyter Notebook checkpoints
.ipynb_checkpoints

# Virtual environments
venv/
env/

# Streamlit's cache directory
.streamlit/
